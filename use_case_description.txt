Case Description: CrisisGuard
CrisisGuard addresses a common failure during emergencies: unreliable or delayed mobile network connectivity. In real-world crisis situations, a traveling user may lose internet access, experience delayed message delivery, or regain connectivity only briefly. Traditional safety apps assume continuous network availability and often fail under these conditions.
To solve this, CrisisGuard uses a distributed mobile agent system built with the Droidrun framework. The system involves two Android devices:
A traveling device, which sends crisis alerts via SMS and WhatsApp. These messages may be delivered late or out of order due to network instability.
A home device, which runs a persistent crisis-response relay agent. When it receives a crisis message, the agent interprets the situation and sends back concise, low-bandwidth safety instructions, optimized for short connectivity windows (10–20 seconds).
The home agent remains active throughout the crisis, responding to follow-up questions and status updates until the user explicitly confirms safety (e.g., “SAFE”). Communication is designed to be SMS-first to minimize latency and maximize reliability, with internet messaging used only when it does not delay response delivery.
This approach ensures that meaningful guidance can still reach the user even when connectivity is intermittent, making CrisisGuard suitable for real-world emergency scenarios involving travel, remote locations, or poor network conditions.
